    Chronolabs Cooperative presents
    
     - For Superior Timekeeping ~ Transmultiversity organisation at home+out!
    
    The Chronolabs cooperative has been operating from Sydney and around Australia
    from June 2006, we have and offer both closed and open source solutions to
    both the website consumer (Someone who needs a website) which can be either
    Person, Business or Government we also offer some Scientific testing and
    forensic systems as well as study broader topics away from web-design, the
    internet that are Boarder-line in this industry and beyond.
    
    Starting as a small start-up in 2006, Chronolabs has gone from strength to
    strength in supporting the Open Source community, namely XOOPS (xoops.org)
    which was adopted by Chronolabs as a lot of the programmers from our community
    of developing this period was new to languages like PHP and LAMP Stack and
    XOOPS being OOP CI which is used in all VS and VS.NET it was the ideal choice
    for in-depth analysis and learning these open control mechanism coming from a
    Visual Studio and Visual Studio .NET

This is an example to show how you would normally mount across a organisation I have
Used the Christian Brothers (De La Salle) for the example; in mounting category 3 of
stienheaders, the stienheaders still haven't been updated since the beginning of the
release of stien and are caught in stall in the Four Empresses!


To Execute all you need to to is fire the crons following:

 * ./php/stiens-compiler.php
 * ./php/send-emails.php
